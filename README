Answers Bot
=========================
Answers Bot is...
1. A Ruby Jabber client using XMPP4r
2. A little project to help me learn Ruby better.

To Do:
1. Get better and responding to greetings.
2. Respond to "thank you"s
3. Ask if the question was what they wanted (and log it)
4. Ask if they want related data (be able to target affirmative and negative responses)
5. Add in more APIs
6. Ask for answers to related questions or questions based on their previous topics.
7. Properly daemonize it.
More to come!
